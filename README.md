# ToDO - page that help you remember about your task!

<br>

## What is the purpose of this project?
This project purpose is to show my skills in using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and related libraries. I aim to create webpage that functions as to-do list. I am not trying to showcase my UI design abilities, so the look of this website may not be impressive. I am just focusing on backend mechanics.

## How does it work?
I programmed the website to allow users to create and use accounts that are stored in a database. This ensures that each user has their own tasks. Without accounts, it would be impossible to store or retrieve tasks created by users. Each task is stored in a separate database that is linked to the user's database.

## How to run it on your copmuter?
It's simple. First, clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vronst/To_do_flask_page.git
```
then install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now if there was no error, simply type in terminal (in the directory this project resides):
```bash
python .\main.py
```
